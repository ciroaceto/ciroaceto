# Hi there, I'm Ciro Aceto 👋

## About Me
- 💼 Industrial Engineer turned Reinforcement Learning Engineer
- 🌱 On a mission to apply Reinforcement Learning to industrial control
- 🔬 Exploring intelligent Water Treatment Technologies in the [intelWATT](https://intelwatt.eu/) project

## My Expertise
- 👨‍💻 Primary focus on Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement Learning
- 🐍 Proficient in Python and some C/C++
- 🧰 Familiar with Python frameworks such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Pytorch, RLlib, stable-baselines3...
- 🚀 Exploring the capabilities of the [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/) platform for Reinforcement Learning developments

## Current Project
I'm currently working on the European innovation project, [intelWATT](https://intelwatt.eu/). intelWATT is a Horizon 2020 funded project that aims to create intelligent Water Treatment Technologies for water preservation combined with simultaneous energy production and material recovery in energy-intensive industries. Three TRL7 case studies will be implemented in crucial EU and global industrial applications such as electricity production, mining, and metal plating.
